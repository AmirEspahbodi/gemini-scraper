        "prompt_output": "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two tiny particles (like electrons or photons) become linked in a way that they share a single existence. Even if you separate them by billions of miles, they remain connected.\n\nWhen you measure the state of one particle, the other particle instantly changes its state to match or oppose it, faster than the speed of light.\n\nHere is a simple breakdown of how it works.\n\n1. The Core Concept: \"The Magic Coins\"\n\nTo understand entanglement, we have to forget how normal objects work.\n\nImagine you have two coins. You keep one and give the other to a friend who travels to the other side of the galaxy.\n\nIn the normal world: If you look at your coin and it is \"Heads,\" that doesn't change anything about your friend's coin. They are independent.\n\nIn the Quantum world (Entanglement): Imagine these are \"Magic Entangled Coins.\" While they are flying through space, they are not Heads or Tails yet. They are both spinning (a state called Superposition).\n\nThe moment you catch your spinning coin and see that it is Heads:\n\nYour friend's coin instantly stops spinning.\n\nIt becomes Tails.\n\nIt doesn't matter that your friend is light-years away. The moment you \"forced\" your coin to decide a state, the other coin \"knew\" and instantly assumed the opposite state.\n\n2. Why is this so weird?\n\nThis phenomenon upset many famous physicists, including Albert Einstein.\n\nCommon Sense says: Objects should have a set state (like a pair of shoes in boxes—if you have the left one, the right one is definitely in the other box).\n\nQuantum Mechanics says: The \"shoes\" don't decide if they are left or right until you open the box.\n\nEinstein famously called this \"Spooky action at a distance\" because it seemed to break the rule that nothing can travel faster than light.\n\n3. The Catch: No \"Faster-Than-Light\" Texting\n\nYou might think, \"Great! I can use this to send instant messages to Mars!\"\n\nUnfortunately, you can't.\n\nYou cannot control which side your coin lands on. It is random.\n\nYou might get Heads, Heads, Tails, Heads.\n\nYour friend sees Tails, Tails, Heads, Tails.\n\nYour friend sees a random pattern just like you do. They only know it’s a message if you call them (using regular, slower-than-light radio) and compare your notes. Therefore, no actual information travels faster than light.\n\n4. What is it used for?\n\nEven though we can't use it for instant texting, entanglement is the power source behind two major technologies:\n\nQuantum Computers: They use entangled particles to perform calculations that are impossible for supercomputers.\n\nQuantum Cryptography: It allows us to create \"unhackable\" codes. If a hacker tries to \"peek\" at the entangled particles while they are being sent, the entanglement breaks (the coins stop spinning), and the receiver knows instantly that the line is tapped.\n\nSummary Table\n\nFeature\tClassical World (Normal)\tQuantum World (Entangled)\nState\tDefinite (It is Heads or Tails)\tUndefined (Spinning/Superposition)\nConnection\tNone (Independent)\tLinked (One system)\nDistance\tDistance delays connection\tDistance doesn't matter\nAnalogy\tTwo different emails\tTwo magic dice\nExport to Sheets\n\nWould you like me to explain how this relates to \"Schrödinger's Cat,\" or how it is used in Quantum Computers?"

        "prompt_output": "The history of the internet is a complex evolution from a government defense project to a global utility that connects billions of people. It is generally divided into several distinct eras, moving from infrastructure building to the creation of the user-friendly World Wide Web.\n\nHere is a summary of the key milestones in the history of the internet.\n\n1. The Cold War & Conceptualization (1950s–1969)\n\nThe internet was born out of the Cold War. After the Soviet Union launched Sputnik in 1957, the US Department of Defense formed ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) to ensure US military technology remained superior.\n\nPacket Switching: Researchers Paul Baran (USA) and Donald Davies (UK) independently developed the concept of breaking data into small \"packets\" to be sent across a network. This ensured that if one line was destroyed, data could find another route—a crucial requirement for nuclear survivability.\n\nARPANET (1969): The first precursor to the internet. On October 29, 1969, the first message (\"LO\") was sent from a computer at UCLA to one at Stanford. It was supposed to be \"LOGIN,\" but the system crashed after two letters.\n\n2. Developing the Language (1970s)\n\nIn the 1970s, different networks began to spring up, but they could not talk to one another. They needed a common language.\n\nTCP/IP (1974): Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn developed the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). This architecture allowed distinct networks to interconnect.\n\nEmail (1971): Ray Tomlinson sent the first network email and chose the @ symbol to separate the user from the machine.\n\n3. Expansion and Unification (1980s)\n\nThe 1980s marked the transition from a purely military experimental network to an academic and scientific tool.\n\nFlag Day (1983): ARPANET officially switched to TCP/IP on January 1, 1983. Many consider this the official \"birthday of the Internet\" because it created a unified network of networks.\n\nDNS (1983): The Domain Name System was invented. Instead of remembering IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1), users could now type memorable names like .com, .edu, and .gov.\n\nNSFNET (1986): The National Science Foundation funded a high-speed backbone to connect supercomputer centers, effectively replacing ARPANET and opening the network to more universities.\n\n4. The World Wide Web & The Public (1990s)\n\nBefore the 90s, the internet was text-based and difficult to use. This decade changed everything by introducing a graphical interface.\n\nThe World Wide Web (1990): Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN, invented HTML, HTTP, and the first web browser. Note: The \"Web\" is the pages/content; the \"Internet\" is the pipes/infrastructure.\n\nMosaic (1993): The first user-friendly web browser that displayed images inline with text. This popularized surfing the web.\n\nCommercialization (1995): Restrictions on commercial traffic were lifted. Companies like Amazon, Google (1998), and eBay were founded, leading to the \"Dot-com boom.\"\n\n5. The Modern Era: Web 2.0 & Mobile (2000s–Present)\n\nThe internet shifted from static pages (read-only) to dynamic platforms (read-write) and eventually became ubiquitous.\n\nBroadband: Dial-up was replaced by high-speed always-on connections.\n\nWeb 2.0 (Mid-2000s): The rise of user-generated content and social media. Facebook (2004) and YouTube (2005) changed the internet from a library into a community.\n\nThe Mobile Internet (2007): The release of the iPhone brought the full desktop-class internet to pockets, fundamentally changing how humans interact with digital information.\n\nIoT (Internet of Things): Today, the internet connects not just people, but appliances, cars, and industrial machinery.\n\nKey Distinction: Internet vs. World Wide Web\n\nPeople often use these terms interchangeably, but they are different.\n\nFeature\tThe Internet\tThe World Wide Web\nDefinition\tA massive network of networks (hardware/infrastructure).\tA way of accessing information over the medium of the Internet.\nAnalogy\tThe railroad tracks.\tThe trains and cargo.\nKey Protocols\tTCP/IP\tHTTP / HTTPS\nAge\tOrigins in the late 1960s.\tOrigins in 1989/1990.\nExport to Sheets\n\nInteresting Fact: The internet is held together physically by hundreds of thousands of miles of submarine cables on the ocean floor, not satellites. Satellites account for a very small percentage of global traffic.\n\nWould you like me to dive deeper into a specific era, such as the \"Dot-com bubble\" of the late 90s or the mechanics of how the Web was invented at CERN?"

        "prompt_output": "Here is a recipe for Classic Lasagna.\n\nThis recipe uses the traditional Béchamel sauce (a creamy white sauce) rather than ricotta cheese. This method, typical of Northern Italy (Lasagne alla Bolognese), creates a richer, silkier texture that melts in your mouth.\n\nPrep & Cook Time\n\nPrep: 45 mins\n\nCook: 45 mins\n\nTotal: 1 hr 30 mins\n\nServings: 8–10\n\nIngredients\n\n1. The Meat Sauce (Ragù)\n\n2 tbsp Olive oil\n\n1 Yellow onion, finely chopped\n\n1 Carrot, finely chopped\n\n1 Celery stalk, finely chopped\n\n1 lb (450g) Ground beef (lean)\n\n1/2 lb (225g) Italian sausage (mild or spicy, casings removed) or ground pork\n\n2 cloves Garlic, minced\n\n1/2 cup Red wine (dry, like Cabernet or Merlot) - optional, can sub with beef broth\n\n1 can (28 oz) Crushed tomatoes\n\n2 tbsp Tomato paste\n\n1 tsp Dried oregano (or Italian seasoning)\n\nSalt & Pepper to taste\n\n2. The Béchamel (White Sauce)\n\n4 tbsp Unsalted butter\n\n1/4 cup All-purpose flour\n\n3 1/2 cups Whole milk (warmed slightly)\n\n1/4 tsp Nutmeg (freshly grated is best)\n\n1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, grated\n\nSalt & White Pepper to taste\n\n3. The Assembly\n\n1 lb (450g) Lasagna noodles (no-boil or boiled according to package)\n\n2 cups Mozzarella cheese, shredded\n\n1 cup Parmesan cheese, grated (for topping)\n\nInstructions\n\nStep 1: Make the Meat Sauce\n\nSauté Veggies: Heat olive oil in a large pot/Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, and celery. Cook for 5–7 minutes until soft. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.\n\nBrown Meat: Increase heat to medium-high. Add the beef and sausage. Break up the meat with a spoon and cook until browned. Drain excess fat if needed.\n\nSimmer: Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute to deepen the flavor. Pour in the red wine and scrape the bottom of the pot (deglaze) to release browned bits. Let it bubble for 2 minutes.\n\nFinish Sauce: Add crushed tomatoes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 20–30 minutes while you make the white sauce.\n\nStep 2: Make the Béchamel (Creamy White Sauce)\n\nMake Roux: In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1–2 minutes until it smells slightly nutty (do not let it brown).\n\nAdd Milk: Gradually pour in the warm milk slowly while whisking constantly to prevent lumps.\n\nThicken: Simmer gently for 5–8 minutes, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.\n\nSeason: Remove from heat. Stir in the nutmeg, 1/2 cup Parmesan, salt, and pepper.\n\nStep 3: Assemble\n\nPreheat oven to 375°F (190°C).\n\nBase: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.\n\nLayer 1: Place a layer of lasagna noodles (overlap slightly if needed). Spread 1/3 of the remaining meat sauce over noodles. Drizzle 1/3 of the béchamel sauce on top. Sprinkle with a little mozzarella.\n\nLayer 2 & 3: Repeat the pattern: Noodles -> Meat Sauce -> Béchamel -> Mozzarella.\n\nTop Layer: Finish with a final layer of noodles. Top with the remaining béchamel (spread to the edges to keep noodles moist) and the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.\n\nStep 4: Bake\n\nCover: Cover the dish with aluminum foil (spray foil with oil so cheese doesn't stick). Bake for 25 minutes.\n\nUncover: Remove foil and bake for another 15–20 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.\n\nRest: Let the lasagna rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing. This is crucial—if you cut it too soon, the layers will slide apart.\n\nQuick Variation (American Style with Ricotta)\n\nIf you prefer the American style or want to save time by skipping the Béchamel:\n\nSwap: Replace the Béchamel ingredients with 15 oz Ricotta cheese mixed with 1 egg, 1/2 cup Parmesan, and chopped parsley.\n\nLayering: Spread the Ricotta mixture on the noodles instead of the white sauce.\n\nWould you like suggestions for a simple salad or garlic bread recipe to serve with this?"

        "prompt_output": "At its core, Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to make software more flexible, easier to test, and easier to maintain.\n\nTo understand it, let's break the term down:\n\nDependency: An object that another object needs to function (e.g., a car needs an engine).\n\nInjection: Passing that needed object into the dependent object, rather than having the dependent object create it itself.\n\nThe Analogy: The Handheld Console\n\nImagine a handheld gaming console (like a Game Boy or Switch).\n\nWithout Dependency Injection: The console comes with \"Super Mario\" soldered directly onto the circuit board inside. You can play Mario, but if you want to play \"Zelda,\" you have to buy a completely new console. The console is tightly coupled to the game.\n\nWith Dependency Injection: The console has a slot. You (the external force) inject the \"Super Mario\" cartridge. If you want to play \"Zelda,\" you just swap the cartridge. The console doesn't care which game is inside, as long as it fits the slot.\n\nThe Technical Explanation\n\nIn programming, objects often rely on other objects to do their work.\n\nClass A (The Car) needs Class B (The Engine) to run.\n\n1. The \"Wrong\" Way (Tight Coupling)\n\nWithout DI, Class A creates an instance of Class B inside itself.\n\nJava\nclass Car {\n    private V8Engine engine;\n\n    public Car() {\n        // The Car creates its own engine.\n        // It is now strictly stuck with a V8Engine.\n        this.engine = new V8Engine();\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe Problem: If you want to test this car with an electric motor, or upgrade the engine later, you have to modify the Car code. The Car controls the creation of its dependencies.\n\n2. The \"Right\" Way (Dependency Injection)\n\nWith DI, Class A does not create Class B. Instead, Class B is created outside and passed (injected) into Class A.\n\nJava\nclass Car {\n    private Engine engine;\n\n    // The engine is passed in (Injected) via the constructor\n    public Car(Engine incomingEngine) {\n        this.engine = incomingEngine;\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe Benefit: Now, when you create a Car, you can give it a V8Engine, an ElectricEngine, or a fake MockEngine for testing purposes. The Car doesn't care, as long as it gets an engine.\n\nThe Three Main Types of DI\n\nConstructor Injection (Most Common): You pass the dependencies through the class constructor (as seen in the example above). This is best for mandatory dependencies (a car must have an engine to exist).\n\nSetter Injection: You create the object first, then call a method to set the dependency.\n\nExample: car.setGPS(new GarminGPS());\n\nThis is best for optional dependencies (a car can exist without a GPS).\n\nInterface Injection: The dependency provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client that passes itself (the client) to the injector. (This is rarer and more complex).\n\nWhy should you use it?\n\nBenefit\tExplanation\nTestability\tThis is the biggest win. When writing unit tests, you don't want to rely on real databases or APIs. With DI, you can inject \"fake\" (mock) versions of those dependencies to test your code in isolation.\nLoose Coupling\tYour classes are less dependent on specific implementations of other classes. Changing one class is less likely to break another.\nMaintainability\tCode is cleaner and easier to read. You can see exactly what a class needs to function just by looking at its constructor.\nExport to Sheets\n\nSummary\n\nDependency Injection implements a principle called Inversion of Control (IoC).\n\nTraditional: \"I will create the things I need.\"\n\nDI/IoC: \"I will ask for what I need, and something else will provide it.\"\n\nWould you like to see a code example of Dependency Injection in a specific language like Python, JavaScript, or C#?"
